# train-schedule

This is a simple train schedule form that allows the user to manually enter a train's name, destination, start time and frequency in order to track each's train's next arrival.

If needed, a train can be deleted from the schedule by clicking the "delete" button which will remove its entry from both the table as well as the database.
